## 🚀 How to Test the Extension

### Method 1: Extension Development Host

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
3. A new VS Code window opens with the extension loaded
4. Use Command Palette: "AI Chat: Open Chat Interface"

### Method 2: Package and Install

1. Run `npm run package` to create a .vsix file
2. Install using VS Code's extension manager

## 🔧 Configuration Required

**Important**: Users need to configure their OpenAI API key:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for "AI Chat Extension"
3. Enter OpenAI API key in "AI Chat Extension: OpenAI API Key"
4. Choose model in "AI Chat Extension: Model"

## 🎮 Features to Test

### Basic Chat

- [ ] Open chat interface
- [ ] Send messages to AI
- [ ] Receive formatted responses
- [ ] Test markdown rendering

### File Attachments

- [ ] Type `@filename` to trigger file search
- [ ] Select files from autocomplete
- [ ] Use file picker button
- [ ] Verify file content is included in AI context

### Workspace Integration

- [ ] Test with different file types
- [ ] Verify workspace context in AI responses
- [ ] Test error handling (no API key, network issues)

### UI/UX

- [ ] Loading states during AI processing
- [ ] Message timestamps
- [ ] Attachment previews
- [ ] Responsive design

## 🎯 Sample Test Scenarios

1. **Code Analysis**:

   - Attach a JavaScript file
   - Ask: "Analyze this code and suggest improvements"

2. **Bug Finding**:

   - Attach multiple files
   - Ask: "Find potential bugs in these files"

3. **Documentation**:

   - Ask: "Generate documentation for my project"

4. **Refactoring**:
   - Attach a function
   - Ask: "How can I refactor this to be more efficient?"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No API Key**: Extension shows error - configure in settings
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Normal in VS Code editor, webpack compiles successfully
3. **WebView Not Loading**: Check dist/ folder has webview.js
4. **File Search Not Working**: Ensure workspace folder is open

### Debug Steps

1. Check VS Code Developer Console (Help → Toggle Developer Tools)
2. Look for console errors in webview
3. Verify API key configuration
4. Check network connectivity
